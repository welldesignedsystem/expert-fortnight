# Markdown to DOCX

Convert a Markdown source file into a Microsoft Word document while keeping generated artifacts in `output/`.

## Requirements

- `pandoc` must be installed and available on `PATH`.
- The input must be a Markdown file in the workspace.

## Procedure

1. Resolve the input path from the user's argument. If no input is supplied, use the repository's primary Markdown content file, `AEO-Intel_Full_Schedule_and_Content_Library.md`.
2. Resolve the output name from the user's argument. If no name is supplied, use the input filename with its extension changed to `.docx`.
3. Create the output directory if it does not exist:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p output
   ```

4. Convert the document with Pandoc:

   ```sh
   pandoc "<input.md>" --from=gfm --to=docx --output="output/<output-name>.docx"
   ```

5. Confirm the output exists and is non-empty:

   ```sh
   test -s "output/<output-name>.docx"
   ```

6. Report the relative output path and note that files under `output/` are ignored by Git.

## Guardrails

- Keep the source Markdown unchanged.
- Never write generated DOCX files outside `output/` unless the user explicitly asks for another destination.
- Quote paths so filenames containing spaces are handled correctly.
- If `pandoc` is unavailable, report the prerequisite clearly and do not create a partial artifact.
